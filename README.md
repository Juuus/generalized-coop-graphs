This repository includes a sample MATLAB code (coop_graphs.m) for implementation of the (stochastic and deterministic) model developed for studying the emergence of cooperation in networked structures through the concept of generalized reciprocity. For a detailed description please see the paper "Promoting cooperation by preventing exploitation: the role of network structure" available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05951.pdf 

Since the implemenation relies on generating a random graph, in the following we provide links to .m codes developed by third parties that were used in the paper to generate such graphs.
